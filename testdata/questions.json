            "body": "<p>I'm trying to make an array of structs where each struct represents a celestial body.</p>\n<p>I don't have that much experience with structs, which is why I decided to try to use them instead of a whole bunch of arrays. However, I keep on running into numerous different errors. I've tried to implement the techniques that I've seen on various threads and on Stack Overflow (such as <em><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2575921/array-of-structs-in-c\">Array of structs in C</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4173518/c-initialize-array-of-structs\">Initialize array of structs in C</a></em>), however not all of them were applicable.</p>\n<p>Further information for those who have read this far: I don't need any of this to be dynamic, I know/define the size of everything beforehand.  I also need this to be a global array as I'm accessing this in several different methods which have defined arguments (i.e., <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Utility_Toolkit\" rel=\"noreferrer\">GLUT</a> methods).</p>\n<p>This is how I'm defining the struct in my header:</p>\n<pre><code>struct body\n{\n    double p[3]; // Position\n    double v[3]; // Velocity\n    double a[3]; // Acceleration\n    double radius;\n    double mass;\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>I have a list of other global variables that I'm defining before I define the interior of the struct, and one of those is the array of this struct (basically, if I'm being too unclear in my fogged speak, the line below is above the stuff above):</p>\n<pre><code>struct body bodies[n];\n</code></pre>\n<p>Just so you know, <code>n</code> is something that I've legitimately defined (i.e. <code>#define n 1</code>).</p>\n<p>I use this array in several different methods, but the easiest and least space consuming one is a simplified form of my main. Here I initialize all of the variables in each of the structs, just to set the variables for certain before I modify them in some way:</p>\n<pre><code>int a, b;\nfor(a = 0; a &lt; n; a++)\n{\n    for(b = 0; b &lt; 3; b++)\n    {\n        bodies[a].p[b] = 0;\n        bodies[a].v[b] = 0;\n        bodies[a].a[b] = 0;\n    }\n    bodies[a].mass = 0;\n    bodies[a].radius = 1.0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The current error that I'm facing is <code>nbody.c:32:13: error: array type has incomplete element type</code> where line 32 is where I'm making the array of the structs.</p>\n<p>One last clarification: By header I mean the space above <code>int main(void)</code>, but in the same <code>*.c</code> file.</p>\n"

            "body": "<p>My C is a little more than rusty at the moment, so I'm failing to create something I think should be pretty basic.</p>\n\n<p>Allow me to refer to character arrays as strings for this post.  It will make things clearer for both me and you.</p>\n\n<p>What I have is an array that can hold 1 or more strings.  For instance {\"ab\", \"cd\", \"ef\"}.  I want to make another array to store multiple versions of the array of strings.  So something like {{\"ab\", \"cd\", \"ef\"}, {\"gh\", \"ij\"}, {\"kl\"}}.</p>\n\n<p>What I have right now is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>char *arrayOfStrings[50]; // a single array to hold multiple strings\nchar **arrayOfArraysOfStrings[10]; // array to hold multiple snapshots of arrayOfStrings\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The array of strings changes over time and I'm using the array of arrays of strings to basically hold historical snapshots of arrayOfStrings.  My problem comes when I need to access the snapshot array for data.  This is the code I have to put stuff into the snapshot array:</p>\n\n<pre><code>arrayOfArraysOfStrings[input_index] = arrayOfStrings; // you can assume input_index is updated correctly, I've already checked that.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This appears to be incorrect since when I try to access and print out the contents of the snapshot array, it only prints out the information from the most recent arrayOfStrings.  The idea I was going for with this was to store the address of where arrayOfChars is pointing in an entry of the snapshot array so I can access it later.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, access to an entry in the snapshot array is accomplished like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>arrayOfArraysOfChars[historicalIndex][indexOfTargetChar]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There are several questions I'm looking to answer:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Is the method I outlined appropriate for what I'm trying to do or is there a flaw in my overall logic?</li>\n<li>What am I doing wrong with my current code and how do I fix it?</li>\n<li>Is there a better way to do this, and if so, how does initialization of the arrays, addition to the arrays, and reading from the arrays work?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>--edit 4/18--\nPart of the problem is that I'm setting pointers in arrayOfArraysOfStrings to point to the same thing that arrayOfStrings is pointing to.  That's bad since arrayOfStrings gets edited.  I need some way to duplicate a 2D array...  Preferably by simply allocating a new block of memory for arrayOfStrings to point at.</p>\n"
